# Top 10 Fantasy Hockey Sleepers for the 2025 Draft

Every fantasy hockey season brings surprises. The managers who draft **sleepers** â€” undervalued players who outperform their draft cost â€” are the ones who gain the biggest edges.  

Sleepers arenâ€™t just about scoring. In 2025, you should be looking at **schedule advantages, dual eligibility, and peripherals** that turn overlooked players into weekly matchup winners.

## What Makes a True Sleeper?
A sleeper isnâ€™t just a random late pick. Itâ€™s a player who checks multiple boxes:

- **ADP Gap:** Being drafted much later than their projected value.  
- **Role Upside:** Moving up a depth chart or onto a power play unit.  
- **Category Fit:** Contributing across multiple stats (SOG, HIT, BLK, FW).  
- **Schedule Edge:** Playing on off-nights or having 4-game playoff weeks.

## Sleeper Archetypes to Target

### 1. Dual-Eligible Forwards
Players who can slot into multiple positions add lineup flexibility and unlock extra games played.

### 2. PP2 Shooters
Forwards who might not be top-line stars but still generate SOG volume and sneak onto secondary power play units.

### 3. PK Defensemen
Shot-blockers who rack up BLK and HIT while logging big PK minutes.

### 4. Faceoff-Grinding Centers
Centers who can also play RW, stacking FW totals while covering multiple roster spots.

### 5. Deep-Cut Streamers
Players from 4-game teams in Week 1 or playoff weeks â€” draft late, stream early, and pivot later.
