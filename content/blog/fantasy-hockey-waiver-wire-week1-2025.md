# Fantasy Hockey Waiver Wire Picks – Week 1 (2025)

Draft day is over — now the real game begins. Winning early matchups often comes down to who works the **waiver wire** best.

<br><br>

Week 1 of the 2025–26 NHL season (Oct 6–12) has only **one true four-game team**, but there are still valuable opportunities on light nights that can give you the edge over an opponent who isn’t paying attention yet.

## How We Pick Waiver Adds

Our process is simple:  

<br><br>

1. Target the teams with the **most games in Week 1**.  
2. Look for chances to slide skaters into your lineup on nights when you actually have space.  
3. Use the [Rankings page](/rankings) filters to dial in which positions you need and which nights you have open roster spots.  
4. The [Optimizer](/optimizer) can also help you plan ahead, showing which teams play the most games in upcoming weeks.  

<br><br>

The goal isn’t just “off-nights” in general — it’s **off-nights that matter for your roster**. Sometimes you’ll have room even on a heavy Thursday or Saturday, especially for defensemen. The point is to maximize man-games every week.

## Teams to Target in Week 1

This week comes down to just a few key schedules. Streamers from these teams can squeeze in extra games and give you an immediate edge.

<br><br>

### **New York Rangers – 4 Games (Tue, Thu, Sat, Sun)**  
The only four-game team in Week 1.  

- They play on both a **light Tuesday** and the **lone Sunday game** against Washington.  
- Adding even a depth Ranger means you’re nearly guaranteed two bonus games on nights when most of your roster is idle.  
- If you didn’t draft a Ranger, this is your top waiver-wire target.  

<br><br>

### **Los Angeles Kings – 3 Games (Tue, Wed, Sat)**  
An excellent **early-week streaming option**.  

- Playing both Tuesday and Wednesday gives you two man-games from one pickup before benches clog on Thursday’s 14-game slate.  
- They’re easily droppable on Thursday to pivot to a Ranger or another team.  
- This combo can net you **five games from one roster spot** if you play it right.  

<br><br>

### **Washington Capitals – 3 Games (Wed, Sat, Sun)**  
A strong **late-week schedule**.  

- With games on Wednesday and Sunday, Capitals skaters are likely to slot into your lineup without conflict.  
- Sunday’s lone matchup (vs. Rangers) makes Washington one of the most valuable streaming teams for Week 1.  
- Picking up a Capital ensures you finish the week with an extra game when your opponent may have no one left to play.

## Week 1 Schedule Breakdown

- **Tuesday, Oct 7** → 3 games  
- **Wednesday, Oct 8** → 4 games  
- **Thursday, Oct 9** → 14 games (heavy)  
- **Friday, Oct 10** → no games  
- **Saturday, Oct 11** → 16 games (very heavy)  
- **Sunday, Oct 12** → 1 game (WSH @ NYR)  

<br><br>

👉 The key opportunity is to load up on light-night players (Tue/Wed/Sun), since Thursday and Saturday will leave most rosters full.

## Why This Works

Streaming is all about maximizing man-games.  

<br><br>

- A skater averaging **3 shots and 2 hits per game** will give you **12 shots and 8 hits in a 4-game week**, compared to only half that if you hold a two-game depth piece.  
- Off-night players are critical because they ensure your bench isn’t wasted — but sometimes a heavy night works too if you have an open slot at the right position.  
- By paying attention to the schedule, you can consistently squeeze extra categories out of your roster spot.  

<br><br>

In future weeks, we’ll highlight **specific player targets** once there’s fresh season data to work with. For now, Week 1 is all about exploiting the schedule.

## Looking Ahead to Week 2

Smart managers don’t just stream for this week — they set up the next one too.  

<br><br>

- Week 2 features **several four-game teams**, including **Nashville** and **Toronto**, both of which play **Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday**. That means a skater from either team could slide into your lineup early in the week and give you a fast start.  
- Other teams with Mon/Tue games include **Tampa Bay** and **Minnesota**, both good for early-week volume.  
- For pure off-night leverage, look at **Chicago, Detroit, and Utah**, who all play **Mon/Wed/Fri/Sun**. Those schedules can keep your bench active while your opponent’s sits idle.  

<br><br>

👉 Pro tip: If you have a move left on **Sunday night in Week 1**, don’t waste it. Add a player from one of these Week 2 teams so you start the new week with an edge.

## Final Thoughts

Week 1 is your best chance to lock in a quick win.  

<br><br>

Managers who play the waiver wire aggressively from the start usually build an early cushion that pays off later. Your opponent may still be asleep at the wheel — take advantage by streaming Rangers, Kings, and Capitals to maximize man-games.
