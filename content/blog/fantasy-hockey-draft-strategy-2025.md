# Fantasy Hockey Draft Strategy 2025: Value Players with Schedule & Categories

Most draft guides will tell you *when* to draft a player. But the secret to building a winning roster is knowing **how to value players** within the context of your league‚Äôs categories and schedule.  

That‚Äôs where 4th Line Fantasy tools come in. Instead of chasing name value, you‚Äôll draft with an edge by focusing on **dual eligibility, maximizing games played, and playoff-week planning**.

## Why ‚ÄúHow to Value‚Äù Beats Round-by-Round Advice
Round-by-round advice gets outdated quickly. Your focus should be on **categories and roster flexibility**.

- **Match league categories:** Prioritize skaters who can contribute across multiple cats (G, A, SOG, HIT, BLK, FW).  
- **Totals vs per-game:** Don‚Äôt be fooled by last season‚Äôs totals ‚Äî per-game averages reveal who consistently fills the box score.  
- **Avoid goalie noise:** We keep the focus on skaters only.  

üëâ Use the [Rankings page](/rankings) to sort by per-game stats and set **minimum thresholds** that match your league.

---

## Dual Eligibility Is a Roster Superpower
Having a C/RW or LW/D on your roster isn‚Äôt just convenient ‚Äî it‚Äôs a weekly win condition.

- **Extra starts:** Dual-eligible skaters can slide into more lineup slots, especially on off-nights.  
- **Schedule stacking:** Fill Tue/Fri/Sun with flexible players while your opponents leave games on the bench.  

Example: A C/RW who plays four times in Week 1 might give you **2 extra starts** compared to a locked-in single-pos player.

## Stream Smart: Use a Late Pick for a Week 1 Edge

One of the most underrated strategies is using a late-round pick not for season-long upside, but for an **immediate Week 1 streaming advantage**.

Here‚Äôs how it works:

1. **Check Week 1 schedules** ‚Üí find a team with 4 games, ideally with 2+ off-nights (Mon/Wed/Fri/Sun).  
2. **Draft a depth player** from that team late (someone who might not even be drafted in your league).  
3. **Stream for an instant lead** in categories like HIT, BLK, or SOG.  
4. After Week 1, you can drop that player for the next hot waiver add ‚Äî but you‚Äôve already banked a matchup edge.

By drafting one of these players late, you essentially ‚Äúbuy‚Äù **an extra 2‚Äì3 games** in your first matchup, which can swing categories before your opponent knows what happened.

## Plan Backwards from the Fantasy Playoffs
Championships aren‚Äôt won in Week 1 ‚Äî they‚Äôre won in April.  

- **Identify playoff-week schedules now.** Teams with 4-game playoff weeks offer huge leverage.  
- **Avoid schedule traps.** Some teams play only 2 games in key fantasy weeks.  
- **Draft with streaming lanes.** Leave one or two bench spots flexible for future adds.

## Draft-Room Workflow with 4th Line Fantasy
Here‚Äôs a simple way to keep your edge during the draft:

1. Open the [Rankings page](/rankings).  
2. Toggle **per-game averages**.  
3. Set **minimum thresholds** for your scoring categories.  
4. Use the **weekly filter** to check off-night coverage.  
5. Shortlist dual-eligible players for flexibility.  

That‚Äôs it ‚Äî you‚Äôve already drafted smarter than half your league.

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- **Over-valuing name recognition.** A popular scorer with a bad schedule can sink you.  
- **Ignoring roster flexibility.** Single-position stars can clog your lineup.  
- **Not planning for playoffs.** Don‚Äôt waste months only to lose on schedule volume in the finals.

- Do I know which teams play the most in Week 1?  
- Do I have dual-eligible players to fill off-nights?  
- Did I check per-game averages instead of just totals?  
- Do I know my playoff-week schedule outlook?  
- Have I built a plan for peripherals (HIT, BLK, SOG, FW)?
