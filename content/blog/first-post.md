# Welcome to 4th Line Fantasy

Weâ€™re excited to welcome you to **4th Line Fantasy** â€” a brand-new home for fantasy hockey tools, insights, and strategy.

## Why Weâ€™re Different

Fantasy hockey is often won by the smallest margins â€” an extra shot, hit, or block can decide a matchup.  

<br><br>

We focus on **maximizing man-games and schedule leverage**, giving you insights that most managers overlook. Our goal is to help you not just draft a strong team, but manage it to success week after week.
