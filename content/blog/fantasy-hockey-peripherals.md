# The Power of Peripherals: Hits, Blocks, FW & SOG Win Fantasy Hockey Leagues

Fantasy hockey isn’t only about goals and assists. In many leagues, the managers who consistently win are the ones who master **peripheral categories** like hits, blocks, faceoff wins, and shots on goal.  

These “grit stats” are often undervalued on draft day, but with the right strategy you can flip them into weekly wins.

---

## Why Peripherals Are the Market Inefficiency
- **Predictable Roles:** Players who hit or block usually do so every game.  
- **Category Swings:** One extra grinder can decide 2–3 categories in a single week.  
- **Under-drafted Value:** Many top peripherals producers go undrafted, leaving easy waiver-wire targets.

## The Big Four Peripherals

### Hits
- Consistent for physical forwards and defensemen.  
- Best sourced from depth players with stable ice time.  

### Blocks
- Most reliable from defensemen who play PK minutes.  
- Spike in multi-game weeks where deployment is heavy.  

### Faceoff Wins (FW)
- Centers dominate here, but dual-eligible C/RW players provide maximum flexibility.  

### Shots on Goal (SOG)
- Sticky stat for volume shooters — a reliable floor even when points dry up.

## Finding Peripherals with 4th Line Fantasy Tools
👉 Go to the [Rankings page](/rankings) and:  
1. Toggle to **per-game averages**.  
2. Set **minimum thresholds** for HIT, BLK, FW, or SOG.  
3. Filter by **team schedule** (weekly filter).  
4. Shortlist grinders from teams with 4-game weeks and off-night games.  

Result: You’ll uncover hidden gems who don’t show up in standard points rankings but can lock down 2+ categories.

## Build a “Peripherals Bench”
One of the strongest strategies is to dedicate 1–2 bench spots to **streaming peripherals**.  

Example:  
- Add a shot-blocking defenseman from a team with 4 games.  
- Drop after the week, then grab a hitter from another 4-game team.  
- Rinse and repeat all season long.  

---

## Case Study: How a Grinder Wins Weeks
Imagine you add a forward who averages:  
- 3 Hits per game  
- 2 Blocks per game  

On a 4-game week, that’s **12 hits + 8 blocks** — enough to swing both categories.  

Most opponents don’t plan for this, which makes peripherals one of the most exploitable advantages in fantasy hockey.

## Final Thoughts
Winning leagues isn’t always about flashy scorers — it’s about finding hidden value.  

By targeting peripherals, you:  
- Gain access to reliable category swings.  
- Turn undrafted players into matchup winners.  
- Make every week more predictable.
