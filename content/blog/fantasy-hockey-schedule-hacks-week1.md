# Fantasy Hockey Schedule Hacks: Who Plays the Most in Week 1?

Draft day is only the beginning. The managers who win early often do it by **squeezing every last game out of their rosters**.

<br><br>


The easiest way to gain an edge in Week 1 is by targeting teams that play the most games â€” and especially those with **off-night matchups (Mon/Wed/Fri/Sun)** when benches are usually empty.

<br><br>


Letâ€™s break down the 2025â€“26 **Week 1 schedule** (Oct 6â€“12).

---

## Why Week 1 Matters

Early wins in head-to-head leagues build momentum, but they donâ€™t happen by accident â€” they happen when managers maximize **man-games played**.

<br><br>


If you used a late-round pick on a depth player who only plays twice in Week 1, ask yourself: is it worth holding him when you could stream a skater from a team with four games? For example, the **New York Rangers** are the only team with a four-game slate in Week 1. Dropping a fringe player for a Ranger could instantly double your games out of that roster spot.

<br><br>


Better yet, if you drafted a **Los Angeles King** who plays Tuesday and Wednesday and then cut him, you could add a **Ranger** who plays Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday. Thatâ€™s **five man-games** from one roster spot with just a single transaction.

<br><br>


Many managers are hesitant to drop draft picks too soon. Donâ€™t be. In Week 1, most of those fringe players wonâ€™t be claimed right away â€” and even if they are, your opponent is inheriting a player with fewer games, not more. This is the moment where decisiveness is rewarded, because early-season waiver competition is usually lighter.

<br><br>


The math is simple: four games from a streamer averaging 3 shots and 2 hits per game could net you **12 shots and 8 hits**. Compare that to holding a two-game depth piece with the same averages â€” youâ€™re leaving half the production on your bench.

<br><br>


Most importantly, Week 1 is the time to **practice the habit of maximizing man-games**. Matchups are often decided by razor-thin margins â€” a single assist, block, or faceoff win. By getting into this routine early, youâ€™re setting yourself up not just for Week 1, but for a playoff push months down the line.

## Teams with the Most Games in Week 1

Week 1 of the NHL season is unique. Games donâ€™t start until **Tuesday, Oct 7**, with only three matchups:

- **Chicago** at **Florida**
- **Pittsburgh** at **New York Rangers**
- **Colorado** at **Los Angeles**

<br><br>


Thatâ€™s a surprisingly light Tuesday slate, making it an ideal day to squeeze in streamers before benches clog up on the heavier nights.

<br><br>


Thursday (14 games) and Saturday (16 games) will leave most rosters full, while Friday has **no games at all**.

<br><br>


Sunday closes the week with just **one matchup** â€” **Washington** at **New York Rangers**.

<br><br>


This means the **Rangers**, **Kings**, and **Capitals** stand out as the most important schedule targets in Week 1.

---

### **__Los Angeles Kings â€“ Tue, Wed, Sat (3 games)__**

The **Kings** are the premium early-week play. Drafting or streaming a **King** gives you back-to-back games on Tuesday and Wednesday before Thursdayâ€™s logjam. This means you can **bank two man-games** from one roster spot before benches start overflowing later in the week.

<br><br>


- Ideal use: draft a depth **King** late, get two games, then drop for a new streamer Thursday.
- Bonus: still a third game on Saturday, but the real value is those early off-nights.

---

### **__New York Rangers â€“ Tue, Thu, Sat, Sun (4 games)__**

The **Rangers** are the **only team with four games in Week 1**, and they finish with a rare Sunday matchup against **Washington**. That means a **Ranger** skater could realistically play on both a light Tuesday and an ultra-quiet Sunday, giving you two near-guaranteed starts when most of your roster is idle.

<br><br>


- Ideal use: stream a **Ranger** on Tuesday, hold for Thursday/Saturday, and finish strong on Sunday.
- This is how you turn one pickup into **four man-games**, capped by a lonely Sunday lineup slot.
- Pro move: pair a **King** (Tue/Wed) with a **Ranger** (Thu/Sat/Sun) for **five games out of one roster spot** in a single week.

---

### **__Washington Capitals â€“ Wed, Sat, Sun (3 games)__**

The **Capitals** are sneaky valuable because of their **quiet-night schedule**. With games on Wednesday and Sunday, a **Capital** is almost guaranteed to slide into your lineup without conflict. While they donâ€™t hit four games like the **Rangers**, they may be easier to grab on waivers and still give you two high-leverage starts.

<br><br>


- Ideal use: grab a **Capital** for Wednesday/Sunday if youâ€™re already full on Thursday/Saturday.
- Works especially well in deeper leagues where premium streamers disappear fast.

---

### Other 3-Game Teams

Beyond the big three, several other clubs offer three-game weeks: **Boston**, **Calgary**, **Montreal**, **Vegas**, **Chicago**, **Colorado**, **Florida**, and **Pittsburgh**.

<br><br>


These teams donâ€™t have the same off-night leverage, but theyâ€™re still worth targeting for depth, especially if you already roster a player from them.

<br><br>


ðŸ‘‰ The key takeaway: **maximize early-week Kings, ride the full-week Rangers, and sneak in Caps on the quiet nights**. Everything else is secondary.

## Streamer Profiles to Target

When choosing Week 1 streamers, look for these archetypes:

<br><br>


- **Peripheral Grinders:** Players who rack up hits and blocks. In a four-game week, someone averaging 3 hits per game could give you 12+ hits, while the same player in a two-game week would give you only 6. These players are often on the waiver wire and can swing physical categories.

- **Faceoff Specialists:** Depth centers who take a high volume of draws. A 55% faceoff guy taking 12 per game can net you 25+ wins in a 4-game week.

- **Shot Volume Guys:** Wingers who consistently pepper the net. A 3-shots-per-game player suddenly gives you 12 attempts in one week instead of 6. That can be the difference in SOG categories.

- **Versatile Skaters:** Dual-eligible players shine because they can slide into multiple lineup spots. Their flexibility means theyâ€™re far more likely to fit into your empty slots, where a single-position player might be stuck on your bench.

<br><br>


ðŸ‘‰ Use the [Rankings page](/rankings) to filter for minimum thresholds (HIT, BLK, SOG, FW) and lock in streamers who will maximize categories for your roster.

## Off-Night Advantage

Why do off-nights matter?

<br><br>


- Typical NHL schedule stacks games on Tue/Thu/Sat.
- Mon/Wed/Fri/Sun are quieter â†’ your bench players actually play.
- Example: a skater from a team with **three off-night games** could play every time your opponent has an empty slot, giving you an extra 6â€“9 shots or 10+ hits.

<br><br>


This is a general rule every week of the season, but Week 1 makes it even more important.

<br><br>


Itâ€™s rare to see only one game on a Sunday, and you can plan ahead to make sure **you** have the man-games to close out the week â€” not your opponent.

---

## How to Replicate This Every Week

1. Open the [Rankings page](/rankings).
2. Select the **week range** (e.g., Week 1).
3. Filter by **off-night games**.
4. Shortlist streamers who cover weak spots in your roster.

---

## Quick-Start Plan for Week 1

1. Draft or add at least **one LA or NYR skater** in your stream spot to maximize Week 1 man-games.
2. Stream **positions that fit your empty lineup slots** â€” donâ€™t force a player in just because theyâ€™re dual-eligible.
3. Look ahead to Week 2 using the [Fantasy Optimizer](/optimizer) to see which teams play the best schedules. Drop your Week 1 streamer and start all over again.

## Final Thoughts

Week 1 is your best chance to lock in a quick win. Managers who play the schedule right out of the gate usually build a cushion that pays off later.
